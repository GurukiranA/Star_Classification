## Brief Summary

This is a simple star classification Flask app which is trained on the dataset available on Kaggle  which takes in the following input parameters like 

     i.) Temperature                                                    
   
    ii.) Relative Luminosity                 
  
    iii.) Radius                             
   
    iv.) Absolute Magnitude  
   
     v.) What is the color of the star?                                  
     
    vi.) What is the Spectral Class of the Star?                         
    
    vii.) Mass of the Star                                    


   Considering the above parameters, the classification of the stat is shown .


## Aim of the Project
This project was done as part of the Kaggle Competition for Star Classification which aims to find out the classification of the star.

## Project Technical Details

1.) The dataset is trained using Random Forest Model.

2.) Building and hosting the Flask App on Heroku.


    * The user must input several parameters displayed on the webpage
    
    * The final output will be the value of the used car based on the input parameters.
		
## Package Installation

The Code is written in Python (Version 3.7.10).The link for python installation is given [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).If the python available in the system is of a lower version, then it can be upgraded using the pip package to ensure that one has the latest version of pip.To install the requried packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository: 

pip install -r requirements.txt
